# Python Database Application

## Overview
This project is a Python application that provides a simple interface for storing and retrieving data using a database. It is designed to demonstrate how to manage database connections and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-db-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the database connection in `src/db/database.py` as needed.

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:
```
